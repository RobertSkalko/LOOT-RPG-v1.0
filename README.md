# LOOT-RPG-v1.0
Kill bosses, get LOOT!

This is my first game made in Javacsript, jquery and bootstrap. It took me about a week or two I think, it taught me a lot about
naming variables, keeping a clean code and how to navigate through a lot of code!

That's because before this project, I only ever did small challenges on freecodecamp or codewars. 

Now about the game, some important things to know:

- Battle starts 5 seconds after clicking fight button
- All item stats are 100% random, but you can't have 2 of the same stats in 1 item, except if 1st is normal stat and 2nd is upgrade
stat
- Upgrade can change existing stat and use up the upgrade gold, this was made instead of a fail chance
- Max upgrade level is 4
- spell costs are per boss level usually but some cost current or total mana
- you start with 30 boss summons, then each one takes a specified amount of time of game staying open, you can modify this
- you can right click any spell for description
- use right click and left click to manipulate items, they can only be upgraded while in inventory
- you can use keyboard to press the first 9 spells
- player stats are bottom left, in order: hp,mana,damage,dodge,crit,magicpow,healpow > ice,fire,storm,shadow,nature,blood,lifesteal
- bosses can cast NERF skills, which reduce stat to 0, try not to cast icebolt when boss casts Nerf ice dmg on you!

I was a bit lazy on some parts, but that's msotly because I made this game for myself. The only thing missing is probably balance,
i fixed the balance issue by making players choose boss level, so if it's too easy, you can always try fighting stronger bosses!
